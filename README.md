# MedicalBillingApp

This is a console app where a patients can make accounts, log in and keep record of their medical history. They have menu options such as adding a treatment to their history, seeing their bills, paying bills, etc.  This was done as a group project for my computer methodology  class. Other students in the class acted as our clients and told us what they wanted in the app. There is music accompanying the app.
